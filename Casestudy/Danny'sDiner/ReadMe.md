### Data-Driven Recommendations
- **Elite Spender** --> Customer# A spends the highest
- **Frequent Flyer** --> Customer# B visits often
- **Most Popular Item** --> Ramen is purchased mostly among all the menu items
- **A True Taste Explorer** --> Customer# B tastes almost all the menu items while Customer# A and C try only Ramen the most
- **Customer Loyalty Program** -->  Sushi and Curry are the menu items that are purchased immediately by customers who joined the program
- Though Ramen is the most popular item, Sushi and curry add value to the customer's purchases
- Sushi and Curry might be tasty yet costly. Customers wanted to become members and get the items at reduced cost
- **Customer Points** --> Sushi is given a high weightage; each $1 spent gets 10 points, and sushi gets a 2x points multiplier. Customer# B has the highest point compared to other customers
- **Membership Week Bonus** --> Irrespective of any item, the first week after the joining date gets 2x points; Customer# A gets the highest point, indicating he used the membership week bonus at its best and purchased more items in the first week
